# Hi, I'm Warren


I'm a data analyst who is passionate about visualizing relationships, predicting results, and framing stories around Big Data based out of Birmingham, AL. I enjoy working in Python with data as it is a powerful catalyst when properly and thoroughly organized and analyzed. The results of an intensive analysis leading to new understandings and better decisions is extremely rewarding.
